# SMH Bank

## Task Description

Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) allows banking customers to complete basic banking transactions. Anyone with a credit card or debit card can access most ATMs. They are convenient, allowing consumers to perform quick self-service transactions such as deposits, cash withdrawals, bill payments, and transfers between accounts. The use of physical cash has dropped over the last 10 years due to the increased usage of credit/debit cards and the skyrocketing rise of online transactions. Customers still need to be able to access cash anywhere and be able to complete banking transactions without the internet or entering a physical bank. Reliability and security are essential for ATMs as it is dealing with customers details, cash money and transaction data.

In pairs, students are to design a replica of a working Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) system written in Python programming language.
